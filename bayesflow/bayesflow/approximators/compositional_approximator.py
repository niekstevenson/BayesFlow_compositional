    Defines a wrapper for estimating arbitrary compositional distributions of the form:

    Parameters
    ----------
    inference_network : InferenceNetwork
        The inference network used for posterior or likelihood approximation.
    adapter : bayesflow.adapters.Adapter, optional
        Adapter for data processing. You can use :py:meth:`build_adapter`
        to create it. If ``None`` (default), an identity adapter is used
        that makes a shallow copy and passes data through unchanged.
    summary_network : SummaryNetwork, optional
        The summary network used for data summarization (default is None).
    standardize : str | Sequence[str] | None
        The variables to standardize before passing to the networks. Can be either
        "all" or any subset of ["inference_variables", "summary_variables", "inference_conditions"].
        (default is "inference_variables").
    **kwargs : dict, optional
        Additional arguments passed to the :py:class:`bayesflow.approximators.Approximator` class.

        """
        Generates compositional samples from the approximator given input conditions. The `conditions` dictionary is
         preprocessed using the `adapter`. Samples are converted to NumPy arrays after inference.
         Expected shape of each condition variable is (n_datasets, n_compositional, ...), where n_compositional >= 2.

        Parameters
        ----------
        num_samples : int
            Number of samples to generate.
        conditions : dict[str, np.ndarray], optional
            Dictionary of conditioning variables as NumPy arrays.
        compute_prior_score : Callable or {"standard_normal"}, optional
            A function that computes the score of the diffused prior distribution. A callback without a ``time``
            argument is treated as time-independent. Use ``"standard_normal"`` when the standardized inference
            variables have a standard-normal prior under the diffusion. If none is provided, an unconditional score
            is used and the diffusion model must have been trained with condition dropout.
        split : bool, default=False
            Whether to split the output arrays along the last axis and return one sample array per target variable.
        batch_size : int or None, optional
            If provided, the conditions are split into batches of size `batch_size`, for which samples are generated
            sequentially. Can help with memory management for large sample sizes.
        summary_batch_size : int or None, optional
            Batch size used only to compute summary-network outputs. Defaults to
            ``batch_size``. Set this separately when summary encoding can use a
            larger batch than the diffusion solver.
        sample_shape : str or tuple of int, optional
            Trailing structural dimensions of each generated sample, excluding the batch and target (intrinsic)
            dimension. For example, use `(time,)` for time series or `(height, width)` for images.

            If set to `"infer"` (default), the structural dimensions are inferred from the `inference_conditions`.
            In that case, all non-vector dimensions except the last (channel) dimension are treated as structural
            dimensions. For example, if the final `inference_conditions` have shape `(batch_size, time, channels)`,
            then `sample_shape` is inferred as `(time,)`, and the generated samples will have shape
            `(num_conditions, num_samples, time, target_dim)`.
        return_summaries: bool, optional
            If set to True and a summary network is present, will return the learned summary statistics for
            the provided conditions.
        summary_outputs : Tensor | np.ndarray | None, optional
            Precomputed summary outputs to be used as conditions for sampling. If provided, these will be used instead
            of the conditions. Should have shape (n_datasets, n_compositional_conditions, ...).
        **kwargs : dict
            Additional keyword arguments for the sampling process.

        Returns
        -------
        dict[str, np.ndarray]
            Dictionary containing generated samples with the same keys as `conditions`.
