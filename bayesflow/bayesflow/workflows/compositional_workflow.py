class CompositionalWorkflow(BasicWorkflow):
    """
    This class extends the Basic Workflow to support compositional inference, allowing for the generation of
    samples conditioned on multiple datasets or compositional conditions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    simulator : Simulator, optional
        A Simulator object to generate synthetic data for inference (default is None).
    adapter : Adapter, optional
        Adapter for data processing. If not provided, a default adapter will be used (default is None), but
        you need to make sure to provide the correct names for `inference_variables` and/or `inference_conditions`
        and/or `summary_variables`.
    inference_network : InferenceNetwork or str, optional
        The inference network used for posterior approximation, specified as an instance or by
        name (default is "diffusion_model").
    summary_network : SummaryNetwork or str, optional
        The summary network used for data summarization, specified as an instance or by name (default is None).
    initial_learning_rate : float, optional
        Initial learning rate for the optimizer (default is 5e-4).
    optimizer : type, optional
        The optimizer to be used for training. If None, a default Adam optimizer will be selected (default is None).
    checkpoint_filepath : str, optional
        Directory path where model checkpoints will be saved (default is None).
    checkpoint_name : str, optional
        Name of the checkpoint file (default is "model").
    save_weights_only : bool, optional
        If True, only the model weights will be saved during checkpointing (default is False).
    save_best_only: bool, optional
        If only the best model according to the quantity monitored (loss or validation) at the end of
        each epoch will be saved instead of the last model (default is False). Use with caution,
        as some losses (e.g. flow matching) do not reliably reflect model performance, and outliers in the
        validation data can cause unwanted effects.
    inference_variables : Sequence[str] or str, optional
        Variables for inference as a sequence of strings or a single string (default is None).
        Important for automating diagnostics!
    inference_conditions : Sequence[str] or str, optional
        Variables used as direct conditions for inference (default is None).
    summary_variables : Sequence[str] or str, optional
        Variables to be summarized through the summary network before being used as conditions (default is None).
    standardize : Sequence[str] or str, optional
        Variables to standardize during preprocessing (default is "inference_variables"). These will be
        passed to the corresponding approximator constructor and can be either "all" or any subset of
        ["inference_variables", "summary_variables", "inference_conditions"].
    **kwargs : dict, optional
        Additional arguments for configuring networks, adapters, optimizers, etc.

        Draws `num_samples` samples from the approximator given specified composition conditions.
        The `conditions` dictionary should have shape (n_datasets, n_compositional_conditions, ...).

        Parameters
        ----------
        num_samples : int
            The number of samples to generate.
        conditions : dict[str, np.ndarray], optional
            A dictionary where keys represent variable names and values are
            NumPy arrays containing the adapted simulated variables. Keys used as summary or inference
            conditions during training should be present.
            Should have shape (n_datasets, n_compositional_conditions, ...).
        compute_prior_score : Callable or {"standard_normal"}, optional
            A function that computes the score of the diffused prior distribution. A callback without a ``time``
            argument is treated as time-independent. Use ``"standard_normal"`` when the standardized inference
            variables have a standard-normal prior under the diffusion. If none is provided, an unconditional score
            is used and the diffusion model must have been trained with condition dropout.
        summaries : Tensor | np.ndarray | None, optional
            Precomputed summary outputs to be used as conditions for sampling. If provided, these will be used instead
            of the conditions. Should have shape (n_datasets, n_compositional_conditions, ...).
        split : bool, default=False
            Whether to split the output arrays along the last axis and return one sample array per target variable.
        batch_size : int or None, optional
            If provided, the conditions are split into batches of size `batch_size`, for which samples are generated
            sequentially. Can help with memory management for large sample sizes.
        summary_batch_size : int or None, optional
            Batch size used only for summary-network evaluation. Defaults to
            ``batch_size``.
        sample_shape : str or tuple of int, optional
            Trailing structural dimensions of each generated sample, excluding the batch and target (intrinsic)
            dimension. For example, use `(time,)` for time series or `(height, width)` for images.

            If set to `"infer"` (default), the structural dimensions are inferred from the `inference_conditions`.
            In that case, all non-vector dimensions except the last (channel) dimension are treated as structural
            dimensions. For example, if the final `inference_conditions` have shape `(batch_size, time, channels)`,
            then `sample_shape` is inferred as `(time,)`, and the generated samples will have shape
            `(num_conditions, num_samples, time, target_dim)`.
        **kwargs : dict
            Additional keyword arguments passed to the approximator's sampling function.

        Returns
        -------
        dict[str, np.ndarray]
            A dictionary where keys correspond to variable names and
            values are arrays containing the generated samples.
